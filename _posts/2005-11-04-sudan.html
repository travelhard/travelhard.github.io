<p>This article countains more info about Sudan.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p>I only got a 7 days Transit Visa, thanks to</p>
<p>the embassy in Ethiopia, to visit the biggest</p>
<p>country in Africa. So I haven't take time to really visit the country and went almost in a straight to Wadi Halfa (Egyptian border). The contrast with Ethiopia was impressive, people are so nice! Among the more friendly I've met in Africa (Northern Mozambique is a close 2nd). THey all want to get out of Sudan so if you can print some info about getting a visa to your country you'll be a star.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- The kindness of the people</p>
<p>- Desert ride</p>
<p>- No tourist (almost) so you have the country for yourself</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- The 26 hours ride from Kerma to Wadi Halfa (try to break the journey if possible</p>
<p>- The assle to get the visa</p>
