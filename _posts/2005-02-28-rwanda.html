<p>This article countains more info about Rwanda.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
Beautifull landscapes and very friendly locals, at least outside of Kigali! I just loved Rwanda even if there is little to do or see as it's a very small country. Of course there was a genocide 10 years ago, but people are getting over it and live in peace now. Definitly one of my favorite country so far.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Kibuye - Betanie Center</p>
<p>- Landscapes</p>
<p>- Friendly and very helpfull locals</p>
<p>- Partying with Aussies Docs in Gahini</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Bus breakdown between Kibuye and Cyangugu - Worst road in Africa so far!!</p>
<p>- Butare, too big to be nice, too small to be interesting</p>
<p>- The price rise for Gorilla's trekking</p>
<p>- They drive on the right side of the road and the wheel is also on the right so it's very scary!</p>
