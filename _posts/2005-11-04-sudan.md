This article countains more info about Sudan.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :

I only got a 7 days Transit Visa, thanks to

the embassy in Ethiopia, to visit the biggest

country in Africa. So I haven't take time to really visit the country and went almost in a straight to Wadi Halfa (Egyptian border). The contrast with Ethiopia was impressive, people are so nice! Among the more friendly I've met in Africa (Northern Mozambique is a close 2nd). THey all want to get out of Sudan so if you can print some info about getting a visa to your country you'll be a star.

**Highlights** :

- The kindness of the people

- Desert ride

- No tourist (almost) so you have the country for yourself

**Down Sides** :

- The 26 hours ride from Kerma to Wadi Halfa (try to break the journey if possible

- The assle to get the visa
