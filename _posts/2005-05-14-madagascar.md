This article countains more info about Madagascar.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :  
Most probably my favorite country in the world so far! The only down side is that it's so big and slow to get around that even 6 weeks is far from enough to see it all. I'll definitly come back here! The scenaries are amazing, the people are beautifull and very interesting with a lot of culture and traditional beliefs.

**Highlights** :

- Lemur watching in Ranomafana National Park

- Trekking in Isalo National Park and see the Makis lemur

- Lazying around on Island Ste-Marie

- Petting one of the domesticated lemur and hear it purr

**Down Sides** :

- Slow plublic transport (about 50km/h average)

- Lot's of beggar

- Villages spoiled by tourism (Anakao is a good example)
