<p>It sad to admit it but even after 9 months in after Africa I'm still a materialist bastard! It's hard to change 27 years of conditioning.</p>
<p>I realized it when I was sailing for 17 hours in a boat with no food and no place to go or even walk. We were 4 on a 10 meters by 40 cm wooden pirogue, I was laying on my back and let my mind go free. After a few hours of day dreaming I start thinking about a game I used the play at home: Magic. I was thinking of buying some cards I need for the game!! Few hours later I was thinking that I should/might buy a new 64 bits computer when I'll be back home. I was quite disappointed of myself and I'm trying to convince myself that I don't really need those things.</p>
