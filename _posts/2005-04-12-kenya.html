<p>This article countains more info about Kenya.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p>Another country that I was planning to race thru but where I stayed a lot longer than I tought. The main reason is that my father came to see me there and then I had to wait few days for my flight to Madagascar. My expectations were right about this onem very touristy and aim toward tourism, I know that I sticked to to touristy route but still. It's a beautifull country and I enjoyed it a lot beside Nairobi.<br />
When you dare go off the tourist path (beaten track as LP put it) you discover a all new and a lot interesting Kenya. MY first love was Maralal where you can see a lot of Samburu and Turkana. I was invited in a Samburu village on the Archer's Post / Moyale route, it was really interesting to there for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Maralal</p>
<p>- Samburu's village</p>
<p>- Masaai Mara</p>
<p>- Talking with the locals</p>
<p>- Lamu</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Too many tourists</p>
<p>- Nairobi that look like a Western city</p>
<p>- Touts in Nairobi</p>
