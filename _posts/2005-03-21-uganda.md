This article countains more info about Uganda.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :  
I had to hurry a bit because I had to be in Kenya 3 weeks after I got in Uganda. Due to the high price of Gorilla's trekking (365 USD) I had to skip that. I mainly stayed around lake Victoria to get to Kenya faster. Beside the fact that public transport drivers always tries to rip you off people are friendly and you feel very safe to walk at night (not alone and not in Kampala).

**Highlighs** :

- Rafting in Jinja

- Kalangaga - Hornbill Camp Site (Ssesse Island)

- Free internet access in Kampala Backpacker

**Down Sides** :

- Matatu (taxi) drivers

- Crater Lake near Fort Portal

- Unfriendly owner of Kampala Backparcker
