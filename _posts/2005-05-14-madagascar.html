<p>This article countains more info about Madagascar.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
Most probably my favorite country in the world so far! The only down side is that it's so big and slow to get around that even 6 weeks is far from enough to see it all. I'll definitly come back here! The scenaries are amazing, the people are beautifull and very interesting with a lot of culture and traditional beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Lemur watching in Ranomafana National Park</p>
<p>- Trekking in Isalo National Park and see the Makis lemur</p>
<p>- Lazying around on Island Ste-Marie</p>
<p>- Petting one of the domesticated lemur and hear it purr</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Slow plublic transport (about 50km/h average)</p>
<p>- Lot's of beggar</p>
<p>- Villages spoiled by tourism (Anakao is a good example)</p>
