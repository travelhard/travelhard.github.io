This article countains more info about Zambia.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :  
As soon as I cross the border I started smilling! Kids and adults were smilling and waving at us. When I got to Livingstone my cheeks were hurting from all that smilling. There's nice wildlife and rafting in this country but the capital, Lusaka, is quite boring and unappealing.

**Highlights** :

- Rafting the Zambezi (one of the best day so far)

- Chimfunshi Chimp's orphinage in the north of the country

- Jollyboys Backpacker (Livingstine) and the people I met there

- Locals talk to you a lot

- South Luwanga National Parc (2003)

**Down sides** :

- Chachacha Backpacker in Lusaka, one of the worst Backpacker place in Africa
