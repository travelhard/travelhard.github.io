<p>his article countains more info about Zimbabwe.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
I'll be straight, I dindn't like that country. I only spent 2 weeks, one waiting for my Mozambique visa in a nice familly in Harare. As soon as I cross the border, in Victoria Falls, I got harrasse by touts trying to sell me lots of things. I have to admit that I only visited big cities but I didn't feel like exploring. Even Matopo National Park was a disapointement to me.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Nice train system between major towns</p>
<p>- Not very touristy (except Vic Falls) so locals don't always try to rip you off</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Matopo, without a car</p>
<p>- You give your money to Mugabe who's more a dictator than a president</p>
