I've been asked a few times why I choose that name for my site.

I've been called "Hardcore Traveler" by a friend in Tanzania. Because I love hardcore music and because of the route I had done and the one I was planning to take. HardcoreTraveler.com was a bit too long (and already taken) so I had to find something else. I was listening to Andrew W.K. CD I brought with me and when I heard the song Party Hard I thought that Travel Hard would be a nice combination as well.  
Travel Hard, Travel Light, Travel Far!
