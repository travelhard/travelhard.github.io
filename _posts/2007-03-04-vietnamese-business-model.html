<p>Here's a little story of how to generate more business for your entreprise, Vietnam way.</p>
<p>First of all sell an expensive Open Tour Ticket to toursits and overcharged them saying it's TET. Overbook the night bus, make some ppl sleep in the alley to make sure the tourists get affraid. Make the tourists read in the "bible" (Lonely Planet) that there's Minibus for their next destination and have them book a new ticket. Put them back in the same bus. So not only have you paid 2 time the fare, but you're still in the same bus!<br />
Solution? We'll try the train!</p>
