<p>That's another very hard one. There's good and bad things about this practice.</p>
<p>I still think that going on an organized tour/trip to tribe's people is bad. It is very interesting of course but it brings them our values faster than they can take it. They lived for centuries without money (for example) and now they ask 1$ for a picture of them. Doesn't it sounds strange to you? If they don't ask for money, they'll ask for sugar or cigarettes. I think the impact of one or two persons on them is far less then any trucks full of tourists coming to their village for 2 hours. What good is it to them if in 10 or 20 years they don't exist anymore and all wear 2Pac t-shirt? Actually I think we should learn from them, they're usually far more in harmony with nature than us. Isn't it utopist?</p>
