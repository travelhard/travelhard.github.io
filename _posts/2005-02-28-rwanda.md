This article countains more info about Rwanda.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :  
Beautifull landscapes and very friendly locals, at least outside of Kigali! I just loved Rwanda even if there is little to do or see as it's a very small country. Of course there was a genocide 10 years ago, but people are getting over it and live in peace now. Definitly one of my favorite country so far.

**Highlights** :

- Kibuye - Betanie Center

- Landscapes

- Friendly and very helpfull locals

- Partying with Aussies Docs in Gahini

**Down Sides** :

- Bus breakdown between Kibuye and Cyangugu - Worst road in Africa so far!!

- Butare, too big to be nice, too small to be interesting

- The price rise for Gorilla's trekking

- They drive on the right side of the road and the wheel is also on the right so it's very scary!
