<p>This article countains more info about Namibia.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
That's the country of nothingness and emptyness! But a very beautifull nothingness. All the pictures you take look a bit the same: sand, sand, sand and bushes. When I left Namibia I felt a bit empty inside and I deceided to go back when I'll have enough money to rent or buy a full equiped 4X4.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Sossusvlei dunes</p>
<p>- Endless desert</p>
<p>- Sandboarding in Swakopmund</p>
<p>- Drive in the desert and pitch your tent anywhere to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Expensive country</p>
<p>- Need a 4X4 to fully visit and appreciate</p>
<p>- Contact with the locals still hard, but it get better far north-east in the Caprivi Strip</p>
<p>- Swakopmund that looks more like Germany than Africa</p>
