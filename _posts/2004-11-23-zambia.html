<p>This article countains more info about Zambia.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
As soon as I cross the border I started smilling! Kids and adults were smilling and waving at us. When I got to Livingstone my cheeks were hurting from all that smilling. There's nice wildlife and rafting in this country but the capital, Lusaka, is quite boring and unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Rafting the Zambezi (one of the best day so far)</p>
<p>- Chimfunshi Chimp's orphinage in the north of the country</p>
<p>- Jollyboys Backpacker (Livingstine) and the people I met there</p>
<p>- Locals talk to you a lot</p>
<p>- South Luwanga National Parc (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Down sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Chachacha Backpacker in Lusaka, one of the worst Backpacker place in Africa</p>
