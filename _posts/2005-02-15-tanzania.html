<p>This article countains more info about Tanzania.<br />
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
I was planning to stay here only 2 weeks as the country appears touristy and focused on National Park. But Tanzania is more than National Parks and I ended up spending around 6 weeks. I've met lots of great peoples there, locals but mostly ex-pat whit whom I lived a few days or others weeks! At some point I was wondering if Tanzania would ever let me leave! (You can read the mail called : My 2 weeks in Tanzania in the English section for more details)</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<p>- Zanzibar - Bwejuu and Matemwe</p>
<p>- Arusha and all the people I've met there</p>
<p>- It's a cheap country to live in if you stay in local hotels and eat in the street</p>
<p>- Not as touristy as I tought if you stay away from Kilimanjaro and other National Park</p>
<p>- Chipsy Mayai (french fries omellette)</p>
<p><strong>Down Sides</strong>:</p>
<p>- Warm beer</p>
<p>- Always someone to sell you things: tours, safari, neckless, etc</p>
<p>- The boat ride from Mtwara to Dar Es Salaam (read mail)</p>
<p>- Swahili time (see pic)</p>
