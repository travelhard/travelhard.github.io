his article countains more info about Zimbabwe.  
A description of what I did, what I like the most and dislike the most.

**Description** :  
I'll be straight, I dindn't like that country. I only spent 2 weeks, one waiting for my Mozambique visa in a nice familly in Harare. As soon as I cross the border, in Victoria Falls, I got harrasse by touts trying to sell me lots of things. I have to admit that I only visited big cities but I didn't feel like exploring. Even Matopo National Park was a disapointement to me.

**Highlights** :

- Nice train system between major towns

- Not very touristy (except Vic Falls) so locals don't always try to rip you off

**Down Sides** :

- Matopo, without a car

- You give your money to Mugabe who's more a dictator than a president
